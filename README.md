Thank_u is a single page web app created to show gift givers how much gift recipients love their present.

## Concept
Most people who send gifts to loved ones far away will never see how much their their gift was appreciated first hand. On the flip side, as a gift recipient, it can be hard to remember to send a thank you note and really show how much you appreciate the gift you received.

Thank_u was created to address this problem by prompting the gift recipient to send a multimedia thank you card to the sender. The hardest parts about sending a thank you note have always been remembering to send it and figuring out how to start. Thank_u takes care of the hard part for you by sending the gift recipient a reminder to thank the sender and a few templates to choose from.
